MON Day 0:
Begin work and reading for mySQL. (Progress through ERD)
Install and set-up working Python and MySql environments
Students will work though Python Fundamentals
They will progress over the weekend to the NAMES assignment.

TUE Day 1: INTRODUCTIONS AND PURPOSE

Discussion: 9AM - 9:30AM
Brief course outline, what technologies we are going to use and learn. Explain why we teach Python Django and Flask.

Extras: 9:30AM - 11AM
Names assignment: Code review, help push to github

Optionals:
- Regular Expressions (suggested), write a regex for:
1) Capital Letters
2) A number followed by a Letters (e.g. a group)
3) A date in the format Month/Day/Year e.g. 12/04/1997
4) Modify the date regex to accepted other formats: e.g. 12-04-1997, or 12 04 1997
- Bubble Sort (use python's swap, a,b = b,a)
- The Other sorts (selection, insertion)
- CSV, SKIP CRAWLER FOR NOW, UNLESS YOU HAVE LOTS OF TIME!

Algorithms: 11AM - 12PM
Basic 13 Algorithms.

1PM: Names Demo: MANDATORY FOR ANYONE WHO DIDN'T FINISH NAMES! Recorded for later review.

1:30 - 5:30PM OOP Reading, Bikes, Cars, Chaining Methods

5:30 PM Demo: Build a gaggle of humans with OOP!Intro to instantiation, inheritance, methods, init and self.

By tomorrow AM: Make sure you have read the OOP section of the platform.If you are having trouble with Names still: rewatch the video, code along with it, and repeat until you can do it on your own.This might be 10 times! Save each file as a new file e.g. names1.py, names2.py ... then write a short description of how it works.





WED Day 2: FAMILIARITY WITH OOP

Seminar OOP: 9AM-9:30AM
9:30 - 11 Set up and start building a card game (crazy eights) using OOP as a group

11:00AM - 12:00AM
Algorithms: Remove Blanks, Split a String, min/max/average into a string, rotate array.

1PM - 3PM Continue Card Game

3 PM - 5:00PM STOP CARD GAME Python OOP AFTER Animal, Chaining Methods Check-in.Do not do the advanced OOP yet.

5:00 PM mySQL LECTURE. One to One, One to Many, Many to Many Relationships and Normalization

By tomorrow AM: Be sure to be able to write, on your own, the chaining methods assignment. Again if you have to do this 10 or more times, to make sure that you have it down do it. Being able to do these key assignments is mandatory. After you have it down, write down a description of how it works.

Have mySQL installed, and be able to open and start mySQL workbench and build the following ERD diagrams: a single table, two tables (one to many) and three tables (many to many)

sqlZoo.net through L6, JOIN.

THURS Day 3: FAMILIARITY WITH SQL

Discussion: 9AM - 9:30AM Joining and CRUD

Algorithms: 9:30 - 11AM: CRUD/Join algorithms with Python OOP
### SPORTS DAY! ###

Work: 1:30pm - 2:30 pm (Sports Day Recovery - mySQLzoo.net 5-10 (as far as you can get in teams!))

2:30 - 5:30 pm MySQL, Sakila, Countries
5:30 - Many To Many Demo

Mandatory Assignment: Friendships (even if you have to do it with three tables, rather than join back onto its own table)


FRI Day 5:

9AM - 10:00AM
Seminar: Flask, VirtualEnv, Response Request Cycle, Session, POST, GET

Algorithms: 11AM - 12PM
Intro to linked lists (OOP reminder)

Work: 1 PM - EOD
Flask Fundamentals Assignments

Code Review: Counter, Great Number Game, Ninja Gold - Student's Choice. But everyone needs to come with one of these 3 assignments by the end of the day.

For the Weekend:Flask Through Disappearing Ninja, WE STRONGLY SUGGEST COLLABORATING AND PUSHING CODE TO GITHUB (all the time, but especially over weekends). Everyone MUST have registration form done by the end of the weekend.
